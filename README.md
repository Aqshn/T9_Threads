# T9_Threads

This project is a simple implementation of **T9 keypad text processing** using **multithreading**.

## Description

The application processes numeric T9 input and converts it into text.  
Threads are used to handle operations concurrently and improve execution flow.

This repository was created as a **practice task** to understand:
- T9 keypad logic
- Thread usage
- Basic synchronization concepts

## Technologies

- Programming Language: C# 
- Multithreading
- Console Application

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aqshn/T9_Threads.git
cd T9_Threads
